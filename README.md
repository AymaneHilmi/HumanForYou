# HumanForYou (Machine Learning Project)

This project explores the application of machine learning models to predict employee attrition within a company, specifically HumanForYou. We utilized different types of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build predictive insights.

A key component of this project is an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed to enable a company to easily analyze employee attrition. The dashboard only requires a dataset to function, making it highly flexible and user-friendly.

The dashboard offers a variety of visual insights into key factors affecting employee attrition, including:
- Attrition rates by department
- Salary comparisons
- Absence patterns
- Employee retention using survival analysis

This tool provides valuable insights that can help companies make informed decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention strategies.
Developed by 4 engineers as part of a school project.

to run the project don't forget to install dependencies with this command :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to run the StreamLit Dashboard, use this command :
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
